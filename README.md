**Name**: Onyedikachi Onah
**Matriculation Number**: 7221960

## Project Description:
This project is a simple Java program to manage car details and save filtered lists of cars based on make, model usage, year, and price. The solution implements object-oriented programming (OOP) principles using the `Car` class and includes features to write the filtered results to text files.

## Features:
- Filter cars by make and save the list to a file.
- Filter cars by model and check if they have been in use for more than a specified number of years.
- Filter cars by year of manufacture and save cars with a price greater than the specified value.

## Development Environment:
- **IDE**: Eclipse 2024
- **Language**: Java 17
- **JDK**: OpenJDK 17
- **Build Tool**: No specific build tool (just standard Java compilation)

## How to Run the Solution:
1. Compile the code with your preferred Java IDE or command-line tool.
2. Execute the `CarSystem` class to see the results.
3. Check the text files generated for the filtered car lists based on the criteria.

## Usage:
1. Clone this repository using:
